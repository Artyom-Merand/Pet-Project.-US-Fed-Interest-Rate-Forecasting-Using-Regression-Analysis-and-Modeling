In today's world, where economic variables are subject to constant fluctuations, the ability to anticipate changes in the financial environment is key to making informed decisions. In Pet Project, we present a study aimed at predicting the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate using regression analysis and modeling techniques.

Our approach involves not only the construction of regression models, but also an in-depth analysis of the factors affecting the interest rate. We look at aspects such as federal debt, inflation, unemployment rate, dollar index, oil price, GDP and other key indicators of the U.S. economy.

In our research process, we also pay attention to multicollinearity techniques, robustness checks, and residual analysis to ensure the accuracy and validity of our models. The results of this project will not only provide an interest rate forecast, but will also help us understand the factors that significantly influence the Fed's financial decisions.

Also, later in this paper there will be a variable substitution, so I suggest you read the comments more carefully and analyze with me. 

Thank you for your attention!
